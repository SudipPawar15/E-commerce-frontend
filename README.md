# Angular E-Commerce Frontend

This is the frontend of the E-Commerce application built using Angular. It interacts with the backend, which is a Spring Boot application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Angular application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Angular CLI** (optional, but recommended) - Install Angular CLI globally using the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
## Setting Up the Backend API
- Before you run the frontend, make sure that the Spring Boot backend is up and running on localhost (typically on port 8080). You can follow the backend README.md to set up the Spring Boot 
  application and database.Ensure that the backend API is running at http://localhost:8080.

### Running the Angular Application
- Start the development server:

```bash
   ng serve```

-The application will be available at http://localhost:4200.

-You can open this URL in your web browser to see the frontend in action. The Angular app will now make requests to the backend API running at http://localhost:8080.
